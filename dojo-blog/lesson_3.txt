Components are the building blocks and the beating heart of any react application. 
A page is constructed out of multiple components:
    1. a nav bar is a component. 
    2. an article is a component. 
    3. a sidebar is a component. 

As a react developer, your job is to create these components which are then randered to the dom and shown in the web page by react. 
each of these components will contain all of their own templates and logic for that piece of content (see pic 1) 
for example, a navbar component will will contain a template which makes up the html for this bit of content but also any javascript logic, like a function which runs when maybe a logout button is clicked. 

who does it works? 
when you'll go to the index.js file (src folder) you'll see the "<App />" component that is rendering it to the dom at the root position.
